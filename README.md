<h2>Ab initio molecular dynamics study of diamond graphitization to create wear-resistant composites for oil & gas drilling tips</h2>
Diamond particles are widely used as a strengthening phase in polymer and ceramic composites that require better mechanical and thermal properties due to their high parameters, including high strength, high thermal conductivity, wear resistance and erosion resistance. Diamond particles are included in the composition of SiC, C/SiC and C/C composites, providing an increase in thermal conductivity and increasing the characteristics of the composites. Diamond containing composites can be used for oil & gas drilling tips. Composites containing diamond can be attractive because they can reduce the content of expensive diamond while maintaining properties. To obtain the most durable composites with the best properties, it is necessary to know the features of diamond graphitization during the production of composites, which will allow the selection of diamond particles that allow obtaining the highest specific strength. In this study, using the ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) implemented in the SIESTA [1] software package, it was shown that in a vacuum, surface graphitization occurs most intensely on surface (111) than on surface (100). An NPR thermostat, a DZP basis, and a cutoff energy of 200 Ry were used. The result of the study shows that the most suitable particle shape for producing nanocomposites will be the one with the largest surface area (111). This can be achieved by special heat treatment of diamond particles, or by controlling the surface properties of existing particles.
